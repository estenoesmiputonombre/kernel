# Basic concepts

## Multiuser Systems

A multiuser system is a computer that is able to concurrently and independently execute several applications belonging to two or more users.

__Concurrently__ means that applications can be active at the same time and contend for the various resources such as CPU, memory hard disks. and so on.

__Independently__ means that each application can perform its task with no concern for what the applications of the other users are doing.

### Features

* An authentication mechanism for verifying the user's identity

* A protection mechanism against buggy user programs that could block other applications running in the system

* A protection mechanism against malicious user programs that could interfere with or spy on the activity of other users

* An accouting mechanism that limits the amount of resource units assigned to each user
